# gilfoyle 🤓

A CLI to interactively remove unused apps from your Android device.

## Usage

```shell script
~$ gilfoyle
150 third-party applications found

Package name: com.my.app
>  1) View
   2) Uninstall
```

## Install

- Download this repository
- Open `config.json` and set `adb_path`
- Finally, run `java -jar gilfoyle.main.jar` 

## Why the name Gilfoyle? 

The idea was inspired by a dialogue in the series Silicon Valley. In a conversation, Gilfoyle said 
> People don't uninstall apps from their phone

I think he's right, and I thought why don't we create a tool for that 🤷

## Test

Before executing the test

- One device must be connected via adb
- `config.json` should have valid adb path
